							Building materials have life expectancies that can be as short as two years or can exceed 50 years. RJC's Depreciation Reports and Reserve Fund Studies assist with strategic planning approaches towards building maintenance and renewals, so that the future costs associated with these necessary activities can be budgeted for, proactively, without undue financial impact to the owners.
